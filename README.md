# Nook

## Project Description

Nook is a mobile app designed to help university students find available study spots on campus. Common areas and campus hubs are popular places to study, be it for their facilities or convenient location, but they often suffer from variable availability. These locations can range from ample seating to completely packed, and students cannot gauge the availability without physically visiting and seeing for themselves. Other difficulties arise if students want to book a study room, as university booking websites can often be scattered or difficult to navigate.

Nook aims to remedy this by providing students with an estimated current capacity of a building or study space without the need to visit themselves. It also acts to centralize all the booking information for study rooms and allows students to book through the app. 

This project was created as part of **UBC BizTech HelloHacks 2023**, a 2-day hackathon targeted at beginner programmers. Created by **Tracy La, Kobe Shen, Ashley Wu, and Alan Wu**, this project and our respective presentation secured them a respectable **second place** at this event. As the very first hackathon anyone in the team had attended, this was a welcomed surprise that resulted from teamwork and dedication. 

The backend was written in Java and the frontend was made using Figma. Below is a link to the Figma project along with screenshots for the UI of the theoretical app.
